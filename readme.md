patbenatar's Curtain.js
========================================

This is a fork of [Curtain.js](https://github.com/Victa/curtain.js) by @Victa.

# How is this fork any different?

The only change in this fork is one added option (default shown):

```javascript
dropInContent: false
```

When dropInContent is set to true the contents of .content in each "curtain" will slide in from the top
as the user scrolls to reveal that curtain.

# Beware

I have no idea how this plays with any of the more advanced features of curtain.js, such as fixed content. I have only tested it with fairly basic usage with full size background images and content above each image. Use at your own risk.
